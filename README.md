# git-status
git-status is a bash script that summarizes the status of git source code repositories on your system and lists which repositories need attention. IMPORTANT: Before using, you must populate the proj array with your own project names and git repositories.

git-status is documented in the May 2019 issue of Linux Format Magazine (LXF249).
